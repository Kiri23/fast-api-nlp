Worksheet to balance your account

General statement policies for Wells Fargo Bank

Follow the steps below to reconcile your statement balance with your
account register balance. Be sure that your register shows any interest
paid into your account and any service charges, automatic payments or
ATM transactions withdrawn from your account during this statement
period.
A Enter the ending balance on this statement.
$
B List outstanding deposits and other
credits to your account that do not appear on
this statement. Enter the total in the column
to the right.
Description

If your account has a negative balance: Please note that an account
overdraft that is not resolved 60 days from the date the account first
became overdrawn will result in closure and charge off of your account. In
this event, it is important that you make arrangements to redirect any
automatic payments you receive. The closure will be reported to Early
Warning Services. We reserve the right to close and/or charge-off your
account at an earlier date, as permitted by law. The laws of some states
require us to inform you that this communication is an attempt to collect a
debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose.
